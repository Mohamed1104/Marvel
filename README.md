# Marvel

Found a Marvel API and decided to create a webiste using the data I recieved from it

# The Outcome

Created a website with three pages (Home, Characters, Comics).
Each page offers something different. The Home page shows all the latest movies that marvel has released. The Characters page shows all the Characters and also lets you search specific Characters. The comics page shows all the latest comics released within the last year.

# What did I learn

- React-router-dom
- Bootstrap
- Improved my Css styling
- Ternary operators
